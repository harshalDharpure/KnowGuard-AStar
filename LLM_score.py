Examples:

Example 1:
Patient Information: 45-year-old female with irregular menstrual periods, hot flashes, and mood changes
Current Inquiry: Evaluating menopausal transition

Relations:
[0] Perimenopause typically begins in the 40s with irregular cycles and vasomotor symptoms
[1] Polycystic ovary syndrome causes irregular periods and insulin resistance
[2] Hormone replacement therapy can alleviate menopausal symptoms but has cardiovascular risks

Scores: [0.95, 0.6, 0.8]
Explanation: [0] is extremely relevant (0.95) as it perfectly describes perimenopause in the patient's age group. [1] has moderate relevance (0.6) as it explains irregular periods but doesn't fit the age/symptom pattern. [2] is relevant (0.8) as it addresses menopausal symptom management.

Example 2:
Patient Information: 22-year-old male with acute abdominal pain, nausea, and fever
Current Inquiry: Diagnosing acute abdomen

Relations:
[0] Appendicitis commonly presents with right lower quadrant pain, nausea, and fever
[1] Gastroesophageal reflux disease causes chronic heartburn and regurgitation
[2] Inflammatory bowel disease can cause abdominal pain and diarrhea

Scores: [0.9, 0.1, 0.4]
Explanation: [0] is highly relevant (0.9) as it matches the acute presentation perfectly. [1] is irrelevant (0.1) as it describes chronic symptoms, not acute abdomen. [2] has low-moderate relevance (0.4) as it can cause abdominal pain but typically with different characteristics.

Example 3:
Patient Information: 8-year-old child with persistent cough, wheezing, and exercise intolerance
Current Inquiry: Investigating pediatric respiratory symptoms

Relations:
[0] Childhood asthma frequently presents with cough, wheezing, and activity limitations
[1] Pneumonia in children causes fever, cough, and respiratory distress
[2] Congestive heart failure management includes diuretics and ACE inhibitors

Scores: [0.9, 0.5, 0.1]
Explanation: [0] is highly relevant (0.9) as it perfectly describes pediatric asthma symptoms. [1] has moderate relevance (0.5) as it addresses pediatric respiratory symptoms but lacks fever. [2] is irrelevant (0.1) as it discusses adult heart failure treatment, not pediatric respiratory issues.
