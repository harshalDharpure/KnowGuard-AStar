"Somewhat Confident" - I have reasonably enough information to tell that the correct answer is more likely than other possible answers, more information like physical examination results, test results, and medical history, etc. is helpful to make a conclusive decision.
"Neither Confident or Unconfident" - There are evident supporting the correct answer, but further evidence is needed to be sure about the answer.
"Somewhat Unconfident" - There are evidence supporting more than one possible answers, therefore more questions are needed to further distinguish the answers.

    For exmample:
    Patient information: A 19-year-old man is brought to the physician by his mother because she is worried about his strange behavior. He does not have any friends and spends most of his time in his room playing online games. 3. Rather than doing his coursework, he spends most of his time reading up on paranormal phenomena, especially demons. 4. He says that he has never seen any demons, but sometimes there are signs of their presence. 5. For example, a breeze in an enclosed room is likely the “breath of a demon”.
    Medical knowledge: Psychotic symptoms including delusions, hallucinations, bizarre behaviour, illogic ideas, thought blocking, deficiencies in speech, neologisms, incoherence and loose thought associations may be effectively treated with antipsychotic medicines.
    Answer:
    \nREASON: The patient's behavior and the medical knowledge both suggest that the patient might be suffering from a psychotic disorder, such as schizophrenia. However, the patient's mother is worried about his strange behavior, and the patient himself says that he has never seen any demons, but sometimes there are signs of their presence. So, the correct answer is not schizophrenia, but Schizotypal personality disorder.
    \nDECISION: Somewhat Confident
